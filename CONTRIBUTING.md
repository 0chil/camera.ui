# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome from everyone.

This project uses Express for the server and VUE for the client UI.

**Credits goes also to:**

- [@oznu](https://github.com/oznu): I could learn a lot from homebridge-config-ui-x
- [@Sunoo](https://github.com/Sunoo): For the HTTP/MQTT/SMTP implementation
- [@phoboslab](https://github.com/phoboslab/jsmpeg) for the decoder. Without it it would not be possible to display the cameras via an interface
